                <p><b>Q:What should I wear to my first dance class?</b></p>
                <p>A: For your first class, we recommend wearing comfortable, breathable clothing that allows for movement. Leggings, athletic wear, or a fitted t-shirt are perfect. For footwear, ballet slippers or sneakers are ideal depending on the class type. If you're unsure, feel free to contact us in advance, and we'll provide specific recommendations based on the class you're attending.

                <p><b>Q: What is your policy on make-ups for missed classes?</b></p>
                <p>A: We understand that life can get busy! If you miss a class, we offer make-up sessions depending on availability. Please notify us in advance if you can’t attend, and we’ll do our best to schedule a make-up in a similar class. Our goal is to ensure you don’t miss out on your dance training and can continue progressing.
